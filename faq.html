    <h1>FAQ</h1>
 
      <h3>Q: What is Coco Voice?</h3>
      <p>Coco Voice is an all-in-one communication smartphone app. It allows you to send voice, text, and picture messages as well as opt-in to meet new people nearby. Look out for future group chatting, video sharing, and calling features.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: What platforms does Coco support?</h3>
      <p>Coco is currently on iPhone and Android. Look out for future versions on Blackberry and Windows 7.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: Does Coco cost anything?</h3>
      <p>Coco Voice is completely free! Coco uses the same mobile data plan you use for email and web browsing; there are no additional domestic or international charges.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: Why does Coco ask for my phone number?</h3>
      <p>Your phone number allows us to recommend existing contacts who are using Coco. We value your privacy and we will never sell your information to anyone. To learn more about our privacy policy, see the Terms of Service.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: How do I get my friends on Coco Voice?</h3>
      <p>It’s easy. Our app automatically helps you find existing Facebook and mobile contacts who are using Coco. You can also invite new friends on Facebook, Twitter, SMS, or Email—all from the app’s interface.</p>
    <br> 
      <h3>Q: What happens if I lose my phone, change phone numbers or use someone else’s phone?</h3>
      <p>No problem. You can log into your account on any device, and your Coco contacts will always stay the same. However, to prevent misuse, your account can be signed in to Coco on one device only.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: What happens if I lose my Coco username or password?</h3>
      <p>No worries. Click the Forgot password and/or username? link on the login page. Your Coco username and a link to reset your password will be sent to the email address you provided during registration.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: Why was I disconnected?</h3>
      <p>The most common reason is poor Internet or 3G coverage. You may have also signed into Coco on another device.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: Why am I not getting any notifications when new messages arrive (iOS only)?</h3>
      <p>Your Push Notifications are probably turned off. Go to 'Settings' in your Apple device, tap 'Notifications,' tap 'Coco Voice', and turn on 'Alerts'.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: Why does the ‘Share by SMS’ button not work on iPad or iPod?</h3>
      <p>This feature is not currently supported on iPad or iPod.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: What does the green check mark mean?</h3>
      <p>The green check mark indicates that your message was successfully sent and received.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Q: What if my question is not on the list?</h3>
      <p>Send us your feedback, under the settings tab. We love hearing from our users, and we’ll respond to your request promptly.</p>
