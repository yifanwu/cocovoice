        <p>1. Your Acceptance <br>
            This is an agreement between Instanza Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Cocovoice"), the owner and operator of www.cocovoice.com (the “Cocovoice Site”), the Cocovoice software and Cocovoice Client (collectively, including all content available through the Cocovoice Client and Cocovoice Site, the "Cocovoice Service", or the "Service"), and you (“you” or “You”), a user of the Service. <br><br>

            BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, AND COCOVOICE'S PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH CAN BE FOUND AT <a href="http://www.cocovoice.com/terms.html">http://www.cocovoice.com/terms.html</a>, AND WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. <br><br>

            If you do not agree to any of these terms, you may not use the Service. <br><br>

            2. Cocovoice Service <br>
            These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Cocovoice Service. The Cocovoice provided status information may contain links to third party websites that are not owned or controlled by Cocovoice. Cocovoice has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. In addition, Cocovoice will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site. By using the Service, you expressly acknowledge and agree that Cocovoice shall not be responsible for any damages, claims or other liability arising from or related to your use of any third-party website. <br><br>

            3. Cocovoice Access <br>
            A. Subject to your compliance with these Terms of Service, Cocovoice hereby grants you permission to use the Service, provided that: (i) your use of the Service as permitted is solely for your personal, noncommercial use; (ii) you will not duplicate, transfer, give access to, copy or distribute any part of the Service in any medium without Cocovoice's prior written authorization; (iii) you will not attempt to reverse engineer, alter or modify any part of the Service; and (iv) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service. <br><br>

            B. In order to access and use the features of the Service, you acknowledge and agree that you will have to provide Cocovoice with your phone number, as well as the phone numbers of third parties whom you wish to use the Service with. When providing your phone number, you must provide accurate and complete information. You hereby give your express consent to Cocovoice to use the phone numbers you provide for use in providing you access and use of the Service. You may never use another person’s phone number without their permission. You are solely responsible for the status message that is displayed for your phone number. You must notify Cocovoice immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your phone. Although Cocovoice will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Cocovoice or others due to such unauthorized use. <br><br>

            C. You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, "robots," "spiders," "offline readers," etc. or "load testers" such as wget, apache bench, mswebstress, httpload, blitz, etc., that accesses the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to the Cocovoice servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a Cocovoice application, and you are forbidden from ripping the content unless specifically allowed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cocovoice grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Cocovoice reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. While we don't disallow the use of sniffers such as Ethereal, tcpdump or HTTPWatch in general, we do disallow any efforts to reverse-engineer our system, our protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the normal requests made by Cocovoice clients. We have to disallow using request modification tools such as fiddler or whisker, or the like or any other such tools activities that are meant to explore or harm, penetrate or test the site. You must secure our permission before you measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation or spam purposes. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Service with respect to their User Status Submissions (as defined below). <br><br>

            4. Intellectual Property Rights
             The design of the Cocovoice Service along with Cocovoice created text, scripts, graphics, interactive features and the like ("Cocovoice Client") except all User Status Submissions (as defined below), and the trademarks, service marks and logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or licensed to Cocovoice, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under United States and foreign laws and international conventions. The Service is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use only. Cocovoice reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service and the Client. You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Client other than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of User Status Submissions of third parties obtained through the Service for any commercial purposes. <br><br>

            5. User Status Submissions<br>
            A. The Cocovoice Service permits the submission of status text and other communications submitted by you and other users ("User Status Submissions") and the hosting, sharing, and/or publishing of such User Status Submissions. As clarified in the following section, you retain your ownership rights in your User Status Submissions. You understand that whether or not such User Status Submissions are published, Cocovoice does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any submissions. <br><br>

            B. You shall be solely responsible for your own User Status Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. Because Cocovoice is only acting as a repository of data, user submitted statuses do not necessarily represent the views or opinions of Cocovoice, and Cocovoice makes no guarantees as to the validity, accuracy or legal status of any status. In connection with User Status Submissions, you affirm, represent, and/or warrant that: (i) you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Cocovoice to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Status Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the User Status Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service; and (ii) you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Status Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable individual person to enable inclusion and use of the User Status Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms of Service. To be clear: you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Status Submissions, but you have to have the rights in the first place. However, by submitting the User Status Submissions to Cocovoice, you hereby grant Cocovoice a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicenseable and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Status Submissions in connection with the Cocovoice Service and Cocovoice's (and its successor's) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Cocovoice Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each subscriber to your status on the Cocovoice Service a non-exclusive license to access your User Status Submissions through the Service, Email, and mobile phone and to display parts of User Status Submissions as permitted through the functionality of the Service and under these Terms of Service. The foregoing license granted by you terminates once you remove or delete a User Status Submission from the Cocovoice Service. <br><br>

            C. In connection with User Status Submissions, you further agree that you will not: (i) submit material that is copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner to post the material and to grant Cocovoice all of the license rights granted herein; (ii) publish falsehoods or misrepresentations that could damage Cocovoice or any third party; (iii) submit material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise inappropriate; (iv) post advertisements or solicitations of business; (v) impersonate another person; (vi) send or store material containing software viruses, worms, Trojan horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, agents or programs; (vii) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the data contained therein; or (viii) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems or networks. <br><br>

            D. Adult content must be identified as such. Cocovoice does not endorse any User Status Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and Cocovoice expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Status Submissions. Cocovoice does not permit copyright infringing activities and infringement of intellectual property rights via its Service, and Cocovoice will remove all Content and User Status Submissions if properly notified that such Content or User Status Submission infringes on another's intellectual property rights. Cocovoice reserves the right to remove Content and User Status Submissions without prior notice. Cocovoice may also terminate a user's access to its Service, if they are determined to be a repeat infringer, or for any or no reason, including being annoying. A repeat infringer is a User who has been notified of infringing activity more than once and/or has had a User Status Submission removed from the Website more than twice. An annoying person is anyone who is (capriciously or not) determined to be annoying by authorized Cocovoice employees, agents, subagents, superagents or superheros. Cocovoice also reserves the right to decide whether content or a User Status Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Service for violations other than copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, such as, but not limited to excessive length or limited interest. Cocovoice may remove such User Status Submissions and/or terminate a User's access for uploading such material in violation of these Terms of Service at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.<br><br>

            E. You understand that when using the Cocovoice Service you will be exposed to User Status Submissions from a variety of sources, and that Cocovoice is not responsible for the accuracy, usefulness, safety, or intellectual property rights of or relating to such User Status Submissions, and that such User Status Submissions are not the responsibility of Cocovoice. You further understand and acknowledge that you may be exposed to User Status Submissions that are inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable, and you agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against Cocovoice with respect thereto, and agree to indemnify and hold Cocovoice, its Owners/Operators, affiliates, and/or licensors, harmless to the fullest extent allowed by law regarding all matters related to your use of the site. <br><br>

            F. Cocovoice permits you to link to materials on the Service for personal, non-commercial purposes only. Commercial versions are available under separate licensing and terms. Cocovoice reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Cocovoice Service at any time. <br><br>

            6. Warranty Disclaimer<br>

These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and Cocovoice that arises in whole or in part from the Cocovoice Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Delaware. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Notice at <a href="http://www.cocovoice.com/terms.html">http://www.cocovoice.com/terms.html</a>. Privacy and any other legal notices published by Cocovoice, including, but not limited to an end user license agreement, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Cocovoice concerning the Cocovoice Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Cocovoice's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Cocovoice reserves the right to amend or modify these Terms of Service at any time, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. Your use of the Cocovoice Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. <br>

            YOU AND COCOVOICE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE COCOVOICE SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. <br><br>

For example, a status of "Can't talk, please SMS instead" set by phone number <span id="gc-number-0" class="gc-cs-link" title="Call with Google Voice">+1 (415) 555-4444</span> will be available to every user of Cocovoice Services or Cocovoice Software who knows that phone number. In other words: If another Cocovoice Services User has your phone number stored in their Address Book, they will be able see your status information. 

          </span><br><br>We do not share your personally identifiable information (such as name or phone number or email address) with other, third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. <br><br>

            We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Cocovoice Sites. <br><br>

            We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. <br><br>

            Cocovoice also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Cocovoice believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our web site, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Cocovoice, our Users or others.<br><br>

            Your Choices<br>
            You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Cocovoice Sites or to Cocovoice Software, in which case Cocovoice may not be able to provide certain services to you. <br><br>

            To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as SMS authentication in certain cases) to verify your identity before granting you status update access. <br><br>

            Please contact Cocovoice via email or available web forms with any questions or comments about this Privacy Notice, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices. <br><br>

              Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Sites Cocovoice is currently ad-free, but in the future we may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Cocovoice Sites or Cocovoice Software. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser or to Cocovoice Software, the advertisements and links that appear on the Cocovoice Sites or in Cocovoice Software. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. <br><br>

            Cocovoice does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks Cocovoice to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-40) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-40 who have viewed pieces of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Cocovoice Sites or Cocovoice Services, such as the number of times you set a status to determine which ads to deliver to you. <br><br>

            Our Commitment To Data Security<br>
            Cocovoice uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Cocovoice and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Cocovoice makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. <br><br>

            If Cocovoice learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Cocovoice may post a notice on the Cocovoice Sites if a security breach occurs. <br><br>

            Our Commitment To Childrens' Privacy<br>
            Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Cocovoice does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Cocovoice Sites from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is directed to or intended to be used by persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use Cocovoice Software or access the Cocovoice Sites and Service at any time or in any manner. If Cocovoice learns that personally identifiable information of persons under 16 years of age has been collected on the Cocovoice Sites, then Cocovoice may deactivate the account and/or make the status submissions inaccessible. And always, think of the children! <br><br>

            THE PRODUCT AND THE COCOVOICE SITE ARE AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS AGED 13 OR OLDER, IF YOU ARE 13 OR OLDER BUT UNDER THE AGE OF 18, YOU SHOULD REVIEW THESE TERMS WITH YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU AND YOUR PARENT OR GUARDIAN UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS.

            In the event that Cocovoice is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our Users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the (hopefully) unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used. <br><br>
